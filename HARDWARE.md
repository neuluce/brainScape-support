# brainScape Hardware

The brainScape software requires a 
[Polhemus PARTRIOT](https://polhemus.com/motion-tracking/all-trackers/patriot) 
3D digitizer to project source and detector locations onto an MR brain image.

Specifically, the following configuration is recommended:

* Polhemus PATRIOT digitizer with power adapter and serial cable for connecting to PC
* Polhemus TX1 source mounted on left side of glasses using 2 plastic screws (included with TX1 source) and connected to the SOURCE port on the Polhemus PATRIOT
* Polhemus 8-inch Stylus connected to the SENSOR1 port on the Polhemus PATRIOT
* Glasses (generic frames, purchased separately) onto which the TX1 is mounted

The glasses configuration is depicted in the following image:
